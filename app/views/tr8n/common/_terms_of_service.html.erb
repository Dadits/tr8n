including all intellectual property rights, in and to all Submissions, and <%=Tr8n::Config.site_title %> is entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of these Submissions for any purpose, 
commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment, consent or monetary or other tangible compensation to you. To the extent that the foregoing assignment is or becomes 
invalid or unenforceable to any degree or for any reason, you grant <%=Tr8n::Config.site_title %> an irrevocable, perpetual, exclusive, fully-paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide right and license, 
with the right to sublicense, to use, reproduce, display, perform, create derivative works of, distribute and otherwise exploit the Submissions in any manner.
